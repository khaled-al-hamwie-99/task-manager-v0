# about 
this is an api for adding , editing and deleting tasks

## in order to make it working

in order to make it working u need to : 

- create a mongodb atlas to store your task in the cloud  
- then store the url connection in a variable by the name **MONGODB_URL** inside config/dev.env so u can use the src/db/setEnviroment.js to connect to the data base and create task and edit them
